Planning Meeting (November 12)
Controller Package:
- Storage class to be started (Cameron)
	- main methods to be started are loading and saving client data (including flight and itinerary information)
- Backend class to be started (Rene)
	- main methods include getting and booking itineraries. Adding flights may also be included (note: need to extract input from front end)
- To add a new password class for password hashing (cannot store raw password as it is not secure) (Salman)
	- needs to be started. Will need monitoring as it's a completely new class.
Travel Package:
- User abstract class to be started (Yuanyuan)
	- Client and Administrator classes to also begin, mainly consisting of objects with getters/setters to be used by storage and backend in controller
- Flight and Itinerary classes to be started (Yuanyuan)
	- mainly variables and getters/setters.
Status meeting to be in 2-3 days (14-15 November depending on circumstances)

Status meeting (November 15)
Controller Package:
- Storage class finished (Cameron)
	- most things finished. Some exceptions still need to be implemented.
	- needs to be tested.
- Backend class started (Rene)
	- skeleton of all necessary methods complete. Need to begin completing.
	- Algorithm of itinerary searching to be started (Salman)
- Password was instead put into Backend class instead of it's own class (Salman)
